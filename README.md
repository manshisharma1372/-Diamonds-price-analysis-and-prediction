color - diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best);
clarity - a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best));
x - length in mm (0--10.74);
y - width in mm (0--58.9);
z - depth in mm (0--31.8);
depth - total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79);
table - width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95).
